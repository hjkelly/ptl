        Sudo allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser or
        another user, as specified by the security policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sudo supports a plugin architecture for security policies and
        input/out‚Äêput logging. Third parties can develop and distribute their
        own policy and I/O logging plugins to work seamlessly with the sudo
        front end. The default security policy is sudoers, which is configured
        via the file /etc/sudoers, or via LDAP.  See the Plugins section for
        more information.
